## Dataset

> I downloaded [Saudi Arabia Used Cars][1] dataset, and I selected it based on Udacity standards. The dataset related to used cars collected from [Syarah][2] that enables users to sell their cars. Though the target of this project is visualization, so I work with the cleaned version of data.


## Summary of Findings

> I used the Question-Visualization-Observations framework. This framework involves asking a question from the data, creating a visualization to find answers, and then recording observations.
I found about 16 observations, these observations between univariate, bivariate and multivariate Explorations.
> I am not bring all 16 exploration to explanatory. I'll show one of all exploration type


## Key Insights for Presentation

> - What is most popular gear type for selling cars? (univariate)
> - Does the price increase by car's year? (Bivariate)
> - Is there relation between Price and Year and Gear Type? (Multivariate)
